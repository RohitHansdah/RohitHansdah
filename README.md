# Hi, I'm Rohit! ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸš€ About Me
I am a **DevOps Engineer at Rakuten Mobile Inc., Japan**, with a strong academic and professional background in **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Machine Learning (ML)**, and **Deep Learning**. My current role involves working with **Kubernetes**, **Docker**, and **Python scripting** to build and maintain scalable, reliable systems as part of the **Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)** team.

However, my true passion lies in **AI/ML**, and I am actively seeking opportunities to transition into roles where I can apply my expertise in **ML/AI**, **Computer Vision**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, and **Recommender Systems** to solve real-world problems. I have hands-on experience in building and deploying ML models, working with large datasets, and applying advanced AI techniques to various domains.
